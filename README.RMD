# How much does the soil microbiome/nutrients change from amendment?

# PCoA of all amendments and baseline soils and time

First ordination using weighted unifrac and PCoA, there are no amendments and reads have been rarified to 6k

Second ordinations using the raw object, note that day is not a factor and that this has not been rarefied.

# NMDS of all amendments, baseline soils and time       
Same as above, but now I used NMDS instead of PCoA for the ordination
