### How much does the soil microbiome/nutrients change from amendment?

## PCoA of all amendments and baseline soils and time

First ordination using weighted unifrac and PCoA, there are no amendments and reads have been rarified to 6k

Second ordinations using the raw object, note that day is not a factor and that this has not been rarefied.

## NMDS of all amendments, baseline soils and time       
Same as above, but now I used NMDS instead of PCoA for the ordination

## Shannon Diversity of incubated microcosms. 
There is an OTU in the compost day 14 samples that has super high abundance, likely needs removed.

* Diversity is lowest in alfalfa day 7, this may suggest a more specialized bacterial community on day 7 than the other treatments or that the nutrient level is less selective than the more recalcitrant forms in the other treatments.  

## Relative Abundance of phyla in the inputs and the nutrient profiles of the inputs    
Nutrients contained in inputs:

Were the treatments significantly different? Adonis on the bray-curtis distance

I don't think ANOVA is the correct approach here for determing p-values, this is a question that I need as a stats person.

Anova results on the linear mixed effect model defined by: Inorganic_N~treatment * day, random=~1|replication
