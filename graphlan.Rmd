```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# Make a small file from phyloseq to test with graphlan, let's grab top 10 OTUs
phy <- readRDS("data/IncPhyseqRareClusteredTree") 
  
OTU10 = names(sort(taxa_sums(phy), TRUE)[1:10])
phy10 <- prune_taxa(OTU10, phy) %>%
  filter_taxa(function(x) sum(x) >= 1, TRUE)

plot_tree(phy10, color = "day", label.tips = "Phylum", ladderize = "left", justify = "left" , size = "Abundance") +
  facet_wrap(. ~ treatment)

tree1 = phy_tree(phy10)
ape::write.tree(tree1, "incphy10.nwk")
```

Look at the annotation file from the example from graphlan (HMP)
```{r}

```
